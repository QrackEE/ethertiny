This is a work-in-progress, but I'm trying to see if I can send + receive packets
on an ATTiny.  I don't know if I'm gonna work on it anymore.

This one is a little different than the last one.  It handles sending
arbitrary packets.

To understand what this does, you should probably read the paper in the 
"paper" root folder.

All schematics are available in the "hardware" root folder.
