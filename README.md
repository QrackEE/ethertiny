WARNING

This is a really dangerous project.  Use at your own risk.

By directly ethernet without magnetics to an AVR, you may
cause serious damage, fire, or anything else crazy if there
is a DC offset.  It does not follow 802.3 standards for
10Base-T Ethernet


It has two projects in it:
 t85: uses differential signaling with fixed packets, similar to another
	person's project, igorplug, found here:
	http://www.cesko.host.sk/IgorPlugUSB/IgorPlug-USB%20%28AVR%29_eng.htm

 t85spi: uses the USI, and can send/receive arbitrary packets.

Schematics are in the "hardware/" folder.

See the youtube video for more info:

Paper on T85spi is found in the "paper/" folder.
